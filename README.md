Guess-the-number is a little game in which:
- A random number between 1-20 is generated and is hidden behind the question mark;
- You need to guess that number and get the highest score possible;
- You can restart the game by pressing the 'Again!' button;

  The project combines ES6, HTML and CSS demonstating DOM manipulation without any libraries/frameworks.
